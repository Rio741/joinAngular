  <h2>3. General Information and Mandatory Disclosures</h2>
  <h3>Data Protection</h3>
  <p> The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data
    confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy. When you
    use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally
    identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for
    what purpose this happens. We point out that data transmission on the internet (e.g. when communicating via email)
    can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible. </p>
  <h3>Note on the Responsible Party</h3>
  <p> The responsible party for data processing on this website is: Max Mustermann / Musterstrasse 70 / 575757
    Musterstadt Phone: 0123456789 Email: muster&#64;muster.com The responsible party is the natural or legal person who
    alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g. names, email
    addresses, etc.). </p>
  <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
  <p> Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain
    with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you make a legitimate request for deletion or
    revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, provided we have no other legally permissible
    reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case,
    deletion takes place after these reasons cease to apply. </p>
  <h3> General Information on the Legal Bases for Data Processing on This Website </h3>
  <p> If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a)
    GDPR, if special categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9(1) GDPR. In the case of explicit consent
    to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing also takes place on the basis of Art. 49(1)(a)
    GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g. via device
    fingerprinting), data processing is also based on § 25(1) TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is
    required to fulfill a contract or carry out pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art. 6(1)(b)
    GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR.
    Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The respective legal
    bases in each individual case are explained in the following sections of this privacy policy. </p>
  <h3> Notice Regarding Data Transfers to Countries Not Considered Safe Under Data Protection Law and to US Companies
    That Are Not DPF-Certified </h3>
  <p> Among other things, we use tools from companies based in countries that are not considered safe under data
    protection law, as well as US-based tools whose providers are not certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework
    (DPF). If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to and processed in these countries. We
    would like to point out that in countries not considered safe, a level of data protection comparable to that of the
    EU cannot be guaranteed. We note that the United States is generally considered a safe third country with a level of
    protection comparable to the EU. A data transfer to the USA is therefore permissible if the recipient is certified
    under the "EU-US Data Privacy Framework" (DPF) or has suitable additional safeguards. You will find more information
    on data transfers to third countries, including the recipients of the data, in this privacy policy. </p>
  <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
  <p> In the course of our business activities, we cooperate with various external parties. In some cases, the transfer
    of personal data to these external parties is necessary. We only pass on personal data to external parties if it is
    required for the performance of a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g. disclosure to tax authorities),
    if we have a legitimate interest under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the transfer of data.
    When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers based on a valid data processing agreement. In
    the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded. </p>
  <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
  <p> Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You may revoke any previously given
    consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the
    revocation. </p>
  <h3> Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Marketing (Art. 21 GDPR) </h3>
  <p> IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME, ON GROUNDS
    RELATING TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED
    ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT,
    WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR
    THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT,
    EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
    IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME
    TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR SUCH MARKETING;
    THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING.
    IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART.
    21(2) GDPR).
  </p>
  <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
  <p> In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
    authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work, or the place of the alleged
    infringement. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
  </p>
  <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
  <p> You have the right to receive data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a
    contract in a common, machine-readable format, and to have it handed over to yourself or a third party. If you
    request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically
    feasible. </p>
  <h3>Right to Access, Rectification, and Erasure</h3>
  <p> Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to obtain free information
    about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of the data processing, and, if
    applicable, the right to rectification or erasure of this data. You can contact us at any time about this or with
    any further questions on the subject of personal data. </p>
  <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
  <p> You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time
    regarding this. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. During
      the verification period, you have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data. </li>
    <li> If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you may request the restriction of data processing
      instead of deletion. </li>
    <li> If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have
      the right to request the restriction of processing instead of deletion. </li>
    <li> If you have objected pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balancing of your and our interests must be carried out. As
      long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the
      processing of your personal data. </li>
    <li> If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, such data – apart from being stored – may only be
      processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or for the protection of
      the rights of another natural or legal person, or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union
      or a Member State. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
  <p> For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you
    send to us as the website operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection
    by the change in the browser's address line from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock icon in your browser bar.
    When SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties. </p>
  <h3>Objection to Promotional Emails</h3>
  <p> The use of contact data published as part of the legal notice obligation for sending unsolicited advertising and
    information materials is hereby objected to. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal
    action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails. </p>
  <h2>4. Data Collection on This Website</h2>
  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  <p> Our websites use so-called "cookies". Cookies are small data packets that do not cause any damage to your device.
    They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (persistent
    cookies) on your device. Session cookies are automatically deleted after your visit. Persistent cookies remain
    stored on your device until you delete them yourself or your web browser automatically deletes them. Cookies may be
    set by us (first-party cookies) or by third-party companies (so-called third-party cookies). Third-party cookies
    allow the integration of certain services provided by third-party companies within websites (e.g. cookies for
    processing payment services). Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain
    website functions would not work without them (e.g. the shopping cart function or video display). Other cookies may
    be used to analyze user behavior or for advertising purposes. Cookies that are required to carry out the electronic
    communication process, to provide certain functions you have requested (e.g. for the shopping cart function), or to
    optimize the website (e.g. cookies to measure the web audience), are stored on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR unless
    another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of necessary cookies
    for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If consent has been requested for the
    storage of cookies and comparable recognition technologies, processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of
    this consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25(1) TDDDG); consent can be revoked at any time. You can set your browser to
    inform you about the setting of cookies and to allow cookies only in individual cases, to exclude the acceptance of
    cookies for specific cases or in general, and to activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the
    browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website. You can find out which cookies and services
    are used on this website in this privacy policy. </p>
  <h3>Contact Form</h3>
  <p> If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact data you
    provide there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We
    do not pass on this data without your consent. The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your
    inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for pre-contractual measures. In all other
    cases, processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed to us (Art.
    6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this was requested; consent can be revoked at any time. The
    data you enter in the contact form remains with us until you request its deletion, revoke your consent to storage,
    or the purpose for data storage ceases (e.g., after your inquiry has been fully processed). Mandatory legal
    provisions – especially retention periods – remain unaffected. </p>
  <h3>Inquiry by Email, Telephone, or Fax</h3>
  <p> If you contact us by email, telephone, or fax, your inquiry, including all personal data resulting from it (name,
    inquiry), will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of handling your request. We do not pass this data on
    without your consent. The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry is related to
    contract fulfillment or necessary for pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, processing is based on our
    legitimate interest in the effective handling of inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent
    (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this was requested; consent can be revoked at any time. The data you send us via contact
    inquiries remains with us until you request deletion, revoke your consent, or the purpose of data storage ends
    (e.g., after your request has been fully processed). Mandatory legal provisions – especially statutory retention
    periods – remain unaffected. </p>
  <h3>Comment Function on This Website</h3>
  <p> For the comment function on this site, besides your comment, information about the time the comment was created
    and, if you do not post anonymously, the username you chose will also be stored. </p>
  <h4>Storage Duration of Comments</h4>
  <p> The comments and the associated data are stored and remain on this website until the commented content is
    completely deleted or the comments must be deleted for legal reasons (e.g., offensive comments). </p>
  <h4>Legal Basis</h4>
  <p> The storage of comments is based on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). You can revoke consent you have given at any
    time. This requires a simple notification by email to us. The legality of data processing carried out before the
    revocation remains unaffected by the revocation. </p>
