  <h2>How to Use Join</h2>
  <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <a href="#">Join</a>:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
      <p>
        When you log in to <a href="#">Join</a>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and
        contains
        four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", "Await feedback" and "Done".
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
      <p>
        In <a href="#">Join</a>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
        click on
        "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
        tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
      <p>
        Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks.
        Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
        the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
      <p>
        As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
        dropping the card from one list to another.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
      <p>
        Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card
        will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
        action is irreversible.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Remember that using <a href="#">Join</a> effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure
    the
    board reflects the current state of your project.
